# About

Iâ€™m Connor, a technical and UX writer based in Manchester, UK. Someone who takes the unbelievably complicated things developers create and makes them understandable for non-technical users.

Here you will find written and visual samples of projects and pieces of work I've managed or had involvement with.

Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), managed using [GitHub](https://github.com/), and hosted on [GitPages](https://pages.github.com/).
