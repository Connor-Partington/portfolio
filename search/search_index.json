I was hired to create and manage documentation for all their products. Audiences Overall the audience for this documentation was well-educated, but not necessarily technical. So the aim was to create easy-to-understand online help, without too much technical jargon, but at the same time, ensuring everything a user may need was covered. Challenges Autocab's existing documentation offered several challenges and opportunities: Documentation was hosted on WordPress with a single static page for release notes The WordPress configuration was disorganised Overused plugins were conflicting and causing issues Documentation didn't adhere to a style guide The documentation contained more marketing copy instead of helpful content Before starting any writing: Time was spent working with Autocab's WordPress site and products to understand how they work. The product categories were organised and the web of conflicting plugins was untangled. A style guide was put in place to maintain a consistent style, voice, and tone across the documentation. User personas were defined and used to set the audience for each product's documentation. The existing documentation was then rewritten to match the style guide and audiences, and new documentation was created to fill in any knowledge gaps for each product. Outcome Instead of a static release notes page, users now had an online knowledge base with categories for each product's documentation, and a search feature to find exactly what they're looking for.","title":"Autocab SaaS"},{"location":"autocabsaas/#autocab-saas","text":"","title":"Autocab SaaS"},{"location":"autocabsaas/#case-study-autocab-2020","text":"Autocab is a leading taxi and private hire booking & dispatch software provider, that offers innovative solutions to help businesses go further.

If you would like to build a similar website then the next section includes a guide on how I did it. Install Python and MkDocs If you have Python installed already then you can skip this step. If not you can download and install the latest release from their website. Then install MkDocs through the command line by running: pip install mkdocs Create a new project Create a project by running the following command in the command line: mkdocs new project Change to your project directory using the cd command: cd project Check you have a folder named project that contains; a docs folder and two files mkdocs.yml , and index.md . For more details on these files see the MkDocs Getting Started guide. Preview your site You can preview your site by running the mkdocs serve command: mkdocs serve This will launch a local version of your site that you can view by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser. Build it Now you've had a look we can go ahead and build your site by running the mkdocs build command; mkdocs build This will create a new folder named site that includes everything you need for a static website. Host your site with GitHub and GitPages If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for your website. Run the next command to make sure your /site folder is ignored by GitHub. echo \"site/\" >> .gitignore Then add your local MkDocs site to GitHub by running the following commands: git init git add . git commit -m \"First commit\" git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL> git push -u origin main The <REMOTE_URL> needs to be replaced with the URL of your repository. Lastly, run the mkdocs gh-deploy command: mkdocs gh-deploy MkDocs will commit and push the local site to your GitHub repository, and your website will be live on GitPages. The URL for your site will look similar to mine, https://connor-partington.github.io/portfolio/ , but it will include your GitHub username and project name instead.","title":"How I built my site"},{"location":"how-I-built-my-site/#how-i-built-my-site","text":"10/12/2022 Previously I used Wix , however, it wasn't the result I was looking for so I decided to rebuild my portfolio using MkDocs , GitHub , and GitPages .
