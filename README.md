# Connor Partington

Hi, I'm Connor Partington, a UK based Technical Writer with several years of technical and UX writing experience. If you need help with technical or user experience writing, let me help you by:

* building you a knowledge base to help your customers self-serve.
* authoring internal and external content for your products and processes.
* collaborating with your teams to design features that are easy to use and understand.
* implementing standard operating procedures to guide your staff and capture knowledge. 

This is my website for showcasing my technical writing experience and helping you get to know me. 

## Why use a Technical Writer?

I'm one of the very first users of your product, and the difficulties I find when using your product are the difficulties your customers might eventually face.

As a Technical Writer, I can take these difficulties and create comprehensive documentation that covers every question an end-user may ask and solutions to each problem they may face. 

## Why me?

I have a unique blend of technical expertise and writing skills that allows me to communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner. 

I've experienced working on various projects, from software documentation to user guides to marketing materials, and have a strong track record of delivering high-quality work on time every time. 

I'm also a strong collaborator who thrives in a team environment, and enjoy helping to create a user-friendly content that has a positive impact on users.
