# Connor Partington

I have several years of technical writing experience, including remote and hybrid working, in:

* Writing and publishing technical content,
* Managing information architecture,
* Leading documentation projects, and
* Collaborating with subject matter experts. 

I take the unbelievably complicated things developers create and make them understandable for multiple audiences.

I have worked with mobile and web software development teams to create easy-to-understand documentation for multiple audiences.

Since 2022, I have added UX Writing to my professional development through courses and writing UX copy for software products.
